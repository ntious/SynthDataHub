=========================
Network Traffic Dataset
=========================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This dataset simulates network traffic data between edge devices in an IoT environment. Each row represents a network communication event with attributes such as **timestamp**, **source_IP**, **destination_IP**, **protocol**, **data_size_bytes**, **threat_category**, **encryption_type**, **network_bandwidth**, and **latency_ms**.

Possible Research Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1.	How does the distribution of network protocols vary in different threat categories?

    2.	What is the relationship between encryption type and data size in network traffic?
    
    3.	How does network bandwidth impact latency in different communication scenarios?
