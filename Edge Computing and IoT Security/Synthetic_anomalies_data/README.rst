===================
Anomalies Dataset
===================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This dataset simulates anomalies detected in the IoT environment. Each row represents an anomaly event with attributes such as **timestamp**, **device_ID**, **anomaly_type**, **severity**, and a **description** of the anomaly.

Possible Research Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1.	What is the distribution of anomaly types in devices of different statuses (active/inactive)?

    2.	How does the severity of anomalies correlate with the device manufacturer?
    
    3.	Can anomalies be predicted based on specific network traffic patterns or device attributes?
