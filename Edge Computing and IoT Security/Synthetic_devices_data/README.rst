======================
Edge Devices Dataset
======================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This dataset simulates information about edge devices in an IoT environment. Each row represents a unique edge device with various attributes such as **device_id**, **device_type**, **location**, **firmware_version**, **ip_address**, **status**, **model**, **operating_system**, **battery_level**, and **last_check-in** timestamp.

Possible Research Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1.	How does the distribution of device types vary across different locations?

    2.	What is the average battery level of devices in different operating systems?
    
    3.	How does the firmware version correlate with the last check-in timestamp?
