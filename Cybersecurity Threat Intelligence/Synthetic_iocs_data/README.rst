===================================
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) 
===================================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This dataset simulates information about potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), **indicator_type** (e.g., IP Address, Domain, File Hash), **indicator_value**, **context**, and **confidence_level**.

Possible Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1.	Threat detection and incident response.

    2.	Analyzing patterns of IoCs to identify potential threats.

    3.	Building and testing IoC-based detection algorithms.

Possible Research Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1.	How does the distribution of IoC types vary over time?

    2.	Can the confidence level of an IoC be used to predict the severity of an incident?
    
    3.	What are the commonalities in context between high-confidence IoCs?
