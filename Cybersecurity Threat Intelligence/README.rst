Synthetic Datasets for Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence
==============================================================

These synthetic datasets provide a foundation for exploring a wide range of research questions, developing predictive models, and simulating various cybersecurity threat scenarios. Researchers can leverage these datasets to enhance their understanding of threat intelligence, test security tools, and contribute to the development of more robust cybersecurity defenses.

Predictive Analytics and Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Predictive Modeling**

    1.	Can machine learning models predict the severity of incidents based on historical IoCs, TTPs, and vulnerabilities?

**Temporal Analysis**

    2.	How do the temporal patterns of TTPs correlate with the occurrence of specific incidents over time?

**Threat Actor Attribution**

    3.	Can machine learning algorithms attribute observed TTPs to specific threat actor types with a high level of accuracy?

**Vulnerability Risk Assessment**

    4.	How well can predictive analytics assess the risk associated with different vulnerabilities and prioritize patching efforts?

**Malware Prediction**

    5.	Can historical data on malware prevalence and characteristics be used to predict future trends in malware attacks?

**Campaign Impact Prediction**

    6.	How accurately can predictive models assess the potential impact and scope of a cyber campaign based on early indicators?

**Integrated Analysis**

    7.	Can an integrated analysis of IoCs, TTPs, and threat actor behavior improve the accuracy of predictive models for incident occurrence?

**Simulation Scenarios**

    8.	How do different simulation scenarios, such as changes in threat actor motives or the discovery of new vulnerabilities, impact the predicted risk landscape?
