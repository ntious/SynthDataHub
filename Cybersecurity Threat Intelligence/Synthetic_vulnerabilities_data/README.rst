=========================
Vulnerabilities Dataset
=========================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This dataset simulates information about known vulnerabilities, including **vulnerability_ID**, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) **cve_ID** and **severity**.

Possible Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1.	Prioritizing and patching vulnerabilities based on severity.

    2.	Analyzing the correlation between exploited vulnerabilities and incidents.

    3.	Assessing the risk associated with specific vulnerabilities.

Possible Research Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1.	How does the severity of vulnerabilities correlate with their exploitation in incidents?

    2.	Can the historical exploitation of vulnerabilities be used to predict future incidents?
    
    3.	What are the common characteristics of vulnerabilities associated with specific threat actors?
