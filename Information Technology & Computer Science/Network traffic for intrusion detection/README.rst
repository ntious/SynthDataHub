The synthetic dataset generated represents a scenario for network intrusion detection, a critical task in information security. The dataset comprises both numeric and categorical features, simulating various aspects of network traffic. Approximately 10% of the dataset contains randomly introduced missing values to mimic real-world scenarios where data may be incomplete or unavailable. This synthetic dataset is designed for training and testing network intrusion detection models, considering the complexities of real-world data, including missing values and diverse features associated with network activities. The total number of records in the dataset is 5020. 

Features overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.	Numeric features

    *	**duration**: Duration of the network activity.
    *	**src_bytes**: Number of source bytes in the communication.
    *	**dst_bytes**: Number of destination bytes in the communication.
    *	**failed_logins**: Number of failed login attempts (additional numeric feature).
    *	**num_file_creations**: Number of file creations (additional numeric feature).

2.	Categorical features

    *	**protocol_type**: Type of network protocol used (e.g., tcp, udp, icmp).
    *	**service**: Type of service associated with the network activity (e.g., http, ftp, ssh).
    *	**flag**: Flag indicating the status of the network connection (e.g., SF, S0, REJ).
    *	**logged_in**: Binary indicator of whether a user is logged in (additional categorical feature).
    *	**is_guest_login**: Binary indicator of whether a guest login is present (additional categorical feature).
    *	**target**: Binary indicator of network intrusion (1) and not intrusion (0).

Possible hypothetical research questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These research questions aim to guide both exploratory data analysis for a deeper understanding of the dataset and data modeling to build effective intrusion detection models while considering missing values and diverse features associated with network activities.

**Data Analysis Research Questions**

1.	Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

    *	How does the distribution of failed login attempts (failed_logins) vary between instances of network intrusion and non-intrusion?
    *	Are there notable differences in the distribution of source bytes (src_bytes) and destination bytes (dst_bytes) when comparing different network protocols (protocol_type)?
    *	How does the distribution of network activity duration vary across different network protocols?
    *	Are there discernible patterns in the distribution of source bytes and destination bytes for different network services?

2.	Missing values analysis

    *	What is the impact of randomly introduced missing values on the analysis of network intrusion detection, and do certain features exhibit a higher prevalence of missing values?
    *	Can we identify any patterns or trends in the missing values, and do they occur more frequently in certain types of network activities or services?

**Data Modeling Research Questions**

1.	Intrusion detection modeling

    *	How effectively can the provided features (duration, src_bytes, dst_bytes, protocol_type, service, flag, failed_logins, num_file_creations, logged_in, is_guest_login) predict instances of network intrusion?
    *	What is the relative importance of each feature in detecting network intrusions, and are there interactions between certain features that significantly impact the model?

2.	Model generalization and robustness

    *	Can the intrusion detection model generalize well across different network protocols (protocol_type) and services (service), or do certain protocols and services require specific detection strategies?
    *	How robust is the predictive model when applied to instances with missing values, and are there specific features for which missing values pose a greater challenge in intrusion detection?
