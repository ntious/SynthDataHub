==================
Weather dataset
==================

The dataset spans from January 1, 1981, to December 2023, providing a time series representation of synthetic weather conditions. The dataset aims to capture key aspects of daily weather patterns, allowing for exploration and analysis of temporal trends, seasonal variations, and potential correlations among the features. Missing values are intentionally introduced to simulate the occasional gaps or errors in real-world observational data. The dataset is designed for educational purposes and can serve as a starting point for practicing time series analysis and data manipulation techniques.
The synthetic time series weather dataset includes the following features, measured in specific metrics:

1.	**Date**: The timestamp indicating the date of each record.

2.	**Temperature**: The ambient air temperature, measured in degrees Celsius. The temperature values are generated with a mean of 20°C and a standard deviation of 5°C, simulating daily temperature variations.

3.	**Humidity**: The relative humidity, measured as a percentage. Humidity values are generated with a mean of 70% and a standard deviation of 10%, capturing typical humidity fluctuations.

4.	**Wind Speed**: The speed of the wind, measured in kilometers per hour (km/h). Wind speed values are generated with a mean of 10 km/h and a standard deviation of 5 km/h, simulating variations in wind intensity.

5.	**Atmospheric Pressure**: The atmospheric pressure, measured in hectopascals (hPa). Atmospheric pressure values are generated with a mean of 1010 hPa and a standard deviation of 5 hPa, representing variations in atmospheric pressure.
