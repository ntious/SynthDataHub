The crop diversity and resilience dataset simulate a scenario where agricultural practices are implemented to assess the diversity and resilience of crops within an agricultural system. This dataset comprises features related to crop diversity metrics, specific crop types, crop rotation practices, intercropping patterns, pest resistance measures, soil characteristics, weather conditions, soil health, crop yield, and an overall crop resilience index. The goal is to explore the intricate relationship between agricultural practices, environmental factors, and the resilience of the agricultural system.
